# Coordinates Display

This mod adds a display of the in-world coordinates of your mouse during the game.

The hope is that this mod can be used as a more exact way of communicating exactly where towers need to be placed for a given strategy when sharing.
(A.k.a no more "line up the range with this little rock here")

Also, while placing a tower, you can press the **Insert** key and it will pop-up an input so you can type in coordinates.
If the tower could be validly placed in that spot, it will be for you.

NOTE: Read the description of the pop-up.
