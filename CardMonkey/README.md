# Card Monkey

This is the Pre-Release of the Card Monkey mod, meant to serve also as an example and template for creating a fully featured (15 upgrades, all crosspaths, custom displays) tower using BTD Mod Helper.

It's currently in a playable enough state, and the coding aspect is basically finished. But, the things I still need to do are:

* Flesh out the Custom Models for Tier 3-4 crosspaths, and touch up the Tier 1 - 2 crosspaths
* Make the different Upgrade Portrait artwork
* More balancing on the costs and strengths of the upgrades
