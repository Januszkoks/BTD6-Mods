# Temple Sacrifice Helper

This mod adds displays for Sun Avatars and Sun Temples that show what the current sacrifice amounts would be for each tower type.

Additionally, this mod  adds an option for the Sacrifices to not happen. You'll see a button in the place where the Ambidextrous Rangs buttons are to let you turn the sacrificing on or off.

By default, it also substantially reduces the price of these upgrades when not sacrificing, since un-sacrificed temples and gods aren't actually all that impressive. The prices $50,000 for Sun Temple and $100,000 for True Sun God by default, but those are configurable. (From some basic testing, those might even be a bit high, actually).
