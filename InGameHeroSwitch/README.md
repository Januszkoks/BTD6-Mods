# In-Game Hero Switch

Ever forget to switch your hero before starting up a game? 
Now you don't have to exit and and come back. 
Just press the **PageUp** and **PageDown** keys to cycle through your unlocked heroes. 
This will work at any point in a match, so long as your hero isn't already placed down.
