# Better Ezili Totem

This mod makes Ezili's Sacrifical Totem mod live up to its name... less. But for the purposes of fun, the ability no longer drains 10 lives in order to use, so it's no longer unusable on Impoppable and CHIMPS.

If this sounds too OP for you, the mod also generates a config file to let you alter the cooldown to bring it more in line.
