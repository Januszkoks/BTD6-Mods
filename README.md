# Doombubbles' BTD6-Mods

The Source Code for my BTD6 Melon Loader Mods.

NKHook6 is **NOT** required for any mods.

If you don't know how to install and use these mods, go [here](https://hemisemidemipresent.github.io/btd6-modding-tutorial/).

**I probably won't be bothering with GitHub releases, so to download a mod just go to its folder and download the .dll file directly.**
