# Doombubbles' BTD6-Mods

The Source Code for my BTD6 Melon Loader Mods.

Most of the mods don't technically require NKHook6, but you should probably just use it with them anyway.

If you don't know how to install and use these mods, go [here](https://gist.github.com/hemisemidemipresent/aae3a2a379e321365738e9d64995e15c).

**I probably won't be bothering with GitHub releases, so to download a mod just go to its folder and download the .dll file directly.**
