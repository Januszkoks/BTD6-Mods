# Doombubbles' BTD6-Mods

The Source Code for my BTD6 Melonloader Mods.

### ALL mods now use BTD Mod Helper, preferably the [latest release](https://github.com/gurrenm3/BTD-Mod-Helper/releases/latest)

If you don't know how to install and use these mods, go [here](https://hemisemidemipresent.github.io/btd6-modding-tutorial/).

**To download a mod, just go to its folder and download the .dll file that's in there.**
