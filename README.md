# Doombubbles' BTD6-Mods

The Source Code for my BTD6 Melon Loader Mods.

Unless explicitly stated, NKHook isn't required.

If you don't know how to install and use these mods, go [here](https://gist.github.com/hemisemidemipresent/aae3a2a379e321365738e9d64995e15c).

**I probably won't be bothering with GitHub releases, so to download a mod just go to its folder and download the .dll file directly.**
