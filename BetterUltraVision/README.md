# Better Ultravision

This mod makes the x/x/2 Ultravision upgrade for the Super Monkey not give such a pitiful range bonus.

By default, Super Range Upgrade give +10 range, while Ultavision only gives +3 range. This mod improves that to +6 range.

This range bonus is changeable in a config, as is the price of Ultravision if you want to change the upgrade cost more due to this increased power (maybe $1500 instead of $1200?).
