# Better Ultravision

This mod makes the x/x/2 Ultravision upgrade for the Super Monkey not give such a pitiful range bonus, and/or make the Supe be able to attack through walls.

By default, Super Range Upgrade give +10 range, while Ultravision only gives +3 range. This mod improves that to +6 range by default.

All this is changeable in a config (you'll need to change the config for seeing through walls), as is the price of Ultravision if you want to change the upgrade cost due to this increased power.
