# Powers in Shop

This mod adds many of the Monkey Money Powers to the in-game shop for purchase with normal currency.

This includes all Tower-based Powers: Monkey Farmer ($500), Tech Bot ($500), Portable Lake ($750), Pontoon ($750) and Energising Totem ($1000); as well as the Track-based Powers: Road Spikes ($50), Glue Trap ($100), Camo Trap ($100), and Moab Mine ($500).

The costs of all these towers are configurable, with the defaults shown above. Prices can be set to a negative number to remove them from the shop.
The pierces for the Track-based powers (all normal by default except for Moab Mine--changed to 1), as is the Recharge Cost and Attack Speed of the Energising Totem ($500 and 15% down from 25%, by default).

Also configurable are allowing the Power Towers in CHIMPS mode (defaults to false) and restricting them as Support towers (defaults to true).

Very special thanks to kenx00x for the idea and starter code.


As far as the future of this mod, I'm probably not going to add any of the other powers; they'd seem very out of place to be purchasable with cash.
