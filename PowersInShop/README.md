#Powers in Shop

This mod adds many of the Monkey Money Powers to the in-game shop for purchase with normal currency.

This includes all Tower-based Powers: Monkey Farmer ($500), Tech Bot ($500), Portable Lake ($1000) and Pontoon ($1000); as well as the Track-based Powers: Road Spikes ($50), Glue Trap ($100), Camo Trap ($100), and Moab Mine ($500).

The costs of all these towers are configurable, with the defaults shown above, as are the pierces for the Track-based powers. Prices can be set to a negative number to remove them from the shop.

Also configurable are allowing the Power Towers in CHIMPS mode (defaults to false) and restricting them as Support towers (defaults to true).


**It it currently a known issue that Road Spikes look like Caltrops while being placed. This is an intentional band-aid fix to the issue that the Road Spikes model currently can't be used in that context. I'm looking into better fixes.**


Very special thanks to kenx00x for the idea and starter code.


As far as the future of this mod, Energizing Totem will be added if I can get it to be rechargeable with in-game cash rather than Monkey Money, but I'm probably not going to add any of the other powers; they'd seem very out of place.
